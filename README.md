# Hangman
Console Interface Based hangman game.

Coded with basic statements. You can modify it but its just a hangman game nothing much.

Alphabet is Turkish Latin Alphabet. You can replace the Alphabet as your wish.

You also have words and hints list at ascii.py file. You can modify it easily even write a script and create .txt file for read and create a function for read and add 2 dimesional list usable for program. 

You can jump into my rep [Python-Web-Scrapping-Script-With-MySql-Database](https://github.com/bceyhann/Python-Web-Scrapping-Script-With-MySql-Database) to see how i create 2 dimensional lists without index limit on python.
